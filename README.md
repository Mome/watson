# Whatson
This is the repository for an experimental Question-Answering-System developed in the context of the "Special Topics in Artificial Intelligence" WS14 course at the University of Osnabr√ºck.

## Installation on Ubuntu
```
git clone https://github.com/mome/watson
cd watson
./install_requirements.sh
```


### System Package Requirements :
* python2.7
* python-pip
* java
* graphviz (optional, for parsetree printing)
* mplayer (optional, for speech synthesis)

### Python Requirements :
* nltk
* html2text
* rdflib
* wikipedia

### External Requirements :
* Stanford Parser
* Stanford NER-Tagger
* Stanford POS-Tagger (optional, future use)

## ToDo:
- introduce answer choice function
- integrate document_search() into QA
  - some function from question to document_search() call (question types)
  - answer generation (answer types)

- document_search(): introduce answer confidence
  - keyword to NER-match distance
  - NER-match in same sentence/subsentence (not only in paragraph)
- expand NER to more than 3 or 7 classes (with some ontology: cyc, dbpedia, ...)
- more document sources than wikipedia (schoolarpedia, wikibooks, maybe own corpus storage (netstore??))
- document indexing
- introduce intaractive learning (human gives feedback)
- have a look on dependency trees, stanford relation extractor, stanford classifier, Stanford Temporal Tagger
